ParticleEngine
==============

This is a simple 2D sprite particle rendering engine created to get my feet wet with Qt and OpenGL. The particle engine was creating using the following:

- C++
- Qt Creator 2.0.1, based on Qt 4.7.0
- OpenGL

Multiple particle emitters can be layered and blended to create different effects.
